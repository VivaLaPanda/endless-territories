[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/VivaLaPanda/endless-territories.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/VivaLaPanda/endless-territories)

This is a package that provides an engine for a 2D adventure game tentatively called
endless territories. The plan is to use a web front end for interaction, and this engine
for the game itself. Our minimum viable product is to have it have exploration working with
one party member on the lowest grid level.

# Micro Roadmap

* Character Movement
* Map rendering
* Map generation
* Simple gameplay interface for testing
